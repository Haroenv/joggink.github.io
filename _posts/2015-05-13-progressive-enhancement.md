The magic word: progressive enhancement. The moment this word gets mentioned our development teams are divided. Some understand the meaning of the web and the importance of building correct and nice web experiences, others don't grasp the importance of the web. There are certain rules, a code of conduct when building for the web, alas not everybody is respecting or following these rules. 

I always start my plea with the fact the web was created with a purpose and that the W3C has a vision and principles:

<blockquote class="quote">
	<p>The social value of the Web is that it enables human communication, commerce, and opportunities to share knowledge. One of W3C's primary goals is to make these benefits available to all people, whatever their hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental ability.</p>
	<cite class="quote__source">
		&mdash; <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission.html#principles">W3C principles</a>
	</cite>
</blockquote>

Before diggin in to all the bullshit arguments people have, let's talk about the history and the advantages.

## History

Before someone coined the term 'progressive enhancement' 

## Advantages

## Common shitty arguments

### Blind people aren't our target audience

### We're building an application, not a website

### We're on a tight budget
